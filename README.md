This project is aimed at designing an efficient system for testing a person’s eligibility for acquiring a driving license. For applicants, it consists of provisions for registering for the test, giving the test and displaying the results immediately. The score is updated after every answer and is visible to the examinee. After the examination the result is displayed and stored for future reference. 

Every examinee gets a unique set of questions randomly selected from the pool of questions made available by the administrator. During the test, the examinee is allowed to change her/his answer as many time before confirming and proceeding. The administrator can update their stock of questions any time, and easily. This includes editing existing questions and options, as well as adding new ones to the database. 


The results of an individual can be accessed via the unique IDs given to each examinee by the system. If needed, all the results can be displayed for comparison. All the confidential information is protected by the use of a password system, accessible only to the administrator. If the password is entered incorrectly three times, the administrator’s menu is blocked to provide against the threat of hackers.

A limitation of the program is that the program is not equipped to check whether the examinee is old enough to be in possession of a driving license.

The system thus has viable scope for real-life implementation, as not only as a means to give the test, but also an input arrangement for examinee registration and result compilation. The system can also be reworked and improved upon to add new features, according to the structuring of a particular academic institution, even one not dealing with vehicle licenses. Though the program provides only for textual questions, graphics can be added. Also, more examinee details can be stored, like date of birth, sex, etc. and filters can be added for displaying the results.
